####  Total time taken: 07:12 min

#### Approaches:

1. SELECT the required columns with `WHERE` clause equals to 13. Order the outcomes by targets. Rank the outputs by `DENSE_RANK()` funtion.
Here, I needed to rank the targets manager wise. So, `PARTITION BY manager_id` and then `ORDER BY target DESC` as maximum targets achievers will be on top.

2. Take the whole query of number#1 approach in a subquery named `employees_by_target` and select `first_name` and `target` again. But now we need only who ranked the top. So, `WHERE ranked_employees = 1`. BOOM!

    COUNT(CASE WHEN year = 2020 THEN 1 END) -
    COUNT(CASE WHEN year = 2019 THEN 1 END ) AS total_car_launch

#### Total Time Taken: 14 min

#### Approaches:

1. First select the company name and count the difference between the launched product counts in 2 years. We wrote
`COUNT(CASE WHEN year = 2020 THEN 1 END` and same for previous year for finding the launched cars counts. So each row in the table shows us the information about
each new launched car.

1. ðŸ’¡ You can use `CASE` statement with 1 condition also. Here is this example. 

2. GROUP the whole query by `company_name`
