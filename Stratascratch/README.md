####  Query
```SQL
SELECT
    first_name,
    target
FROM
(
SELECT 
    first_name,
    target,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY manager_id
                       ORDER BY target DESC) AS ranked_employees
FROM salesforce_employees e
WHERE manager_id = 13
ORDER BY target DESC) AS employees_by_target
WHERE ranked_employees = 1;
```

####  Total time taken: 07:12 min

#### Approaches:

1. SELECT the required columns with `WHERE` clause equals to 13. Order the outcomes by targets. Rank the outputs by `DENSE_RANK()` funtion.
Here, I needed to rank the targets manager wise. So, `PARTITION BY manager_id` and then `ORDER BY target DESC` as maximum targets achievers will be on top.

2. Take the whole query of number#1 approach in a subquery named `employees_by_target` and select `first_name` and `target` again. But now we need only who ranked the top. So, `WHERE ranked_employees = 1`. BOOM!

#### Query:

```SQL
SELECT 
    company_name,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN year = 2020 THEN 1 END) -
    COUNT(CASE WHEN year = 2019 THEN 1 END ) AS total_car_launch
    FROM car_launches
    GROUP BY company_name
    ORDER BY company_name;
```

#### Output:

#### Total Time Taken: 14 min

#### Approaches:

1. First select the company name and count the difference between the launched product counts in 2 years. We wrote
`COUNT(CASE WHEN year = 2020 THEN 1 END` and same for previous year for finding the launched cars counts. So each row in the table shows us the information about
each new launched car.

1. ðŸ’¡ You can use `CASE` statement with 1 condition also. Here is this example. 

2. GROUP the whole query by `company_name`





## ID-2053(Hard)- Retention Rate

Companies Asked: Meta, Salesforce

Find the monthly retention rate of users for each account separately for Dec 2020 and Jan 2021. Retention rate is the percentage of active users an account retains over a given period of time. In this case, assume the user is retained if he/she stays with the app in any future months. For example, if a user was active in Dec 2020 and has activity in any future month, consider them retained for Dec. You can assume all accounts are present in Dec 2020 and Jan 2021. Your output should have the account ID and the Jan 2021 retention rate divided by Dec 2020 retention rate.
